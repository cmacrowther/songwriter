###

Songwriter is a static-site template that serves as a personal portfolio of a musician's songwriting credits and collaborations. It is inspired by the [Spotify Songwriter](https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/songwriter-pages) pages that are currently only available to popular/mainstream artists such as Justin Trantor, Meghan Trainor and Missy Elliot.

You can deploy directly to Netlify using the badge above.
